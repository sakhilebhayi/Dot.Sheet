/**
 * Baseline browser protections on every response. A header the route already set is left alone, so a stricter route-level
 * value (for example a download that sets its own X-Frame-Options) always wins.
 *
 * ENFORCED now: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy and (HTTPS only) Strict-Transport-Security.
 * HSTS is max-age only, with no includeSubDomains and no preload: this domain has many sibling subdomains that are not all ready for it.
 * SECURITY_HSTS_SECONDS in .env changes the age, and 0 turns the header off (see config/security.php).
 *
 * The Content-Security-Policy is REPORT-ONLY (Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only): the browser reports what the policy would have blocked to
 * /csp-report (App\Http\Controllers\CspReportController) and blocks nothing. It is written to be compatible with Livewire and Jetstream, which
 * need inline scripts and 'unsafe-eval' (Alpine evaluates its expressions with the Function constructor). The listed outside origins are the ones
 * the Blade layouts actually load; add one only after a layout starts using it. Enforcing the policy is a later step, taken from the reports.
